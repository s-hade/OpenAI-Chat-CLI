To make the AI work, you need to insert your OpenAI API key into the code — you can get it at https://openai.com/api/

An OpenAI API key is a unique secret code that allows your app or program to access OpenAI’s artificial intelligence services. In simple terms, it’s like a “pass” that verifies your authorization to use the OpenAI API.

Using the OpenAI API incurs charges based on the amount of text (tokens) processed. The final cost depends on the chosen model and the number of requests you make.
